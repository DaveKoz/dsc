Intro
-----
DiscountCoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin.
Our goal is simple, give the world an opportunity to use crypto-currency everyday to buy items at discounted prices in every stores accepting it. The network will reward shop owners making an effort to propose those prices by giving them more coins as they accept more transactions.
Using the emerging technology of Proof-of-stake Masternodes, we plan to reward staking people with coins each time a block is mined. 
As a customer, you will be able to buy your items, pay for the restaurant, or go to the cinema with a discounted price.
As a shop owner, you will sell with a discount but you will earn more tokens by staking them is your wallet, thus making a profit as if you sold for more than initial price.
Our vision is long term based.
We are planning a wide customer usage during first year to build the Discount network and strengthen POS system with an Intial Coin Offering (ICO).
Masternode will be rewarding early adopters by great amount during first year. Then we will promote our technology to local shop owners, still encouraging them to propose discounted prices and earn rewards themselves.
Discount Coin network is designed to give great rewards during at least 20 years !
